[SUBJECT]=Topic or skill to learn
[CURRENT_LEVEL]=Starting knowledge level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
[TIME_AVAILABLE]=Weekly hours available for learning
[LEARNING_STYLE]=Preferred learning method (visual/auditory/hands-on/reading)
[GOAL]=Specific learning objective or target skill level

Step 1: Knowledge Assessment
1. Break down [SUBJECT] into core components
2. Evaluate complexity levels of each component
3. Map prerequisites and dependencies
4. Identify foundational concepts
Output detailed skill tree and learning hierarchy

~ Step 2: Learning Path Design
1. Create progression milestones based on [CURRENT_LEVEL]
2. Structure topics in optimal learning sequence
3. Estimate time requirements per topic
4. Align with [TIME_AVAILABLE] constraints
Output structured learning roadmap with timeframes

~ Step 3: Resource Curation
1. Identify learning materials matching [LEARNING_STYLE]:
   - Video courses
   - Books/articles
   - Interactive exercises
   - Practice projects
2. Rank resources by effectiveness
3. Create resource playlist
Output comprehensive resource list with priority order

~ Step 4: Practice Framework
1. Design exercises for each topic
2. Create real-world application scenarios
3. Develop progress checkpoints
4. Structure review intervals
Output practice plan with spaced repetition schedule

~ Step 5: Progress Tracking System
1. Define measurable progress indicators
2. Create assessment criteria
3. Design feedback loops
4. Establish milestone completion metrics
Output progress tracking template and benchmarks

~ Step 6: Study Schedule Generation
1. Break down learning into daily/weekly tasks
2. Incorporate rest and review periods
3. Add checkpoint assessments
4. Balance theory and practice
Output detailed study schedule aligned with [TIME_AVAILABLE]
